                In 1919, Francis Scott Fitzgerald moved to New York City to pursue a career in writing. However, after having his work endlessly rejected, he returned to his family's home in Minnesota and revised his draft of <cite class = "cite">This Side of Paradise</cite> while repairing the roofs of cars. The final draft was accepted for publishing in the fall of 1919, sold in March of 1920, and instantly became a profitable success.</div>
                
                <div class = "introduction">Five years later, in 1925, <cite class = "cite2">The Great Gatsby</cite> was published and received little attention. It was heavily inspired by Scott Fitzgerald’s own life, the pursuit of his spouse - Zelda, his financial ambitions, and his time living in New York City and Great Neck, Long Island. It was not until World War II - after Scott had already passed away - that the novel became popular and was considered a literary classic.</div>
                
                <div class = "introduction">This website hopes to breathe life into the story by mapping out the real-world locations that Scott was inspired by.</div>

                    <p>Not long after arriving to New York, a coworker asks Nick to room together at a commuting town 20 miles east of the city: West Egg – a fictional town which represents King’s Point in Great Neck, Long Island. West Egg is described as the preferred neighborhood for people associated with "New Money" - or newly acquired wealth. The homes and people here are more eccentric than classic or formal.</p><p>Nick agrees to move to West Egg, however the roommate is sent to Washington instead, leaving Nick to move in by himself. He moves in with an old Dodge automobile, a pet dog that soon runs away, and hires a Finnish maid who regularly comes to tidy his room and cook his breakfast.</p><p>Nick’s rental home is described as being on tip of West egg, a short 50 yards away from the Long Island Sound, with a direct view of the water. It includes a shed which he uses to park his car, and the property is situated between two giant homes.</p><p>The house on the right is Gatsby’s home.</p>

Gatsby’s yellow station wagon also drives people to and from the local train station.</p>

Daisy is Nick’s second cousin, and she is married to Tom, who played football at Yale and was also in the same senior society as Nick.</p><p>Tom and Daisy live just across the bay from Nick, at East Egg – which is a fictional town for Sands Point. East Egg is described as the preferred neighborhood for people associated with "Old Money" - or wealth that was generationally inhereted. East Egg has a more classic and regal style of architecture.</p><p>The Buchanan home is a red and white Georgian Colonial mansion with vines growing on the side, gold-framed front French windows, a front porch, connecting verandas, and a lawn that runs a quarter mile from the beach to the door, filled with  sun-dials, brick walkways, and gardens. There is also a dock that goes into the water from the beach, with a flashing green light that shines all day and night.</p><p>At the Buchanan home, Nick learns of Tom’s poorly-hidden affair with another woman, discusses their three-year-old daughter, and also meets Jordan Baker - a childhood friend of Daisy’s who also lives in the house. Some information on Tom and Daisy’s past is also explored, and Tom begins to state his blatantly racist opinions, which infers that he aggressively sees himself above others.</p><p>After 10pm, Jordan retires for the night, and Daisy quickly inquires about a woman Nick is romantically involved with back in Missouri before he leaves to return home.</p>

                <p>Between Nick's home and New York City is a location referred to as the Valley of the Ashes. At the time, this location was a dump site for garbage and ashes collected from the city.</p><p>The area was filled with ridges, hills, chimneys, smoke, and a billboard that advertised an optometrist’s practice in nearby Queens. There was also a river with a drawbridge that would often delay the trains and traffic, and a single yellow-bricked building that stood on the edge of the town. The building housed three shops, one of which was a garage called "Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold".</p>

                    <p>At the Buchanan home, Daisy asks Tom to make everyone cold drinks.</p><p>When Tom leaves the room, Daisy kisses Gatsby in front of both Nick and Jordan, causing Jordan to complain about the action and call Daisy vulgar.</p><p>The Buchanan’s child, Pammy, then enters the room with her nanny, showing off her white dress to Daisy. Daisy reveals that she asked Pammy to wear the dress to meet Gatsby, and tries to introduce the child to the group. However, Pammy instead asks where her father is – Tom. Gatsby also looks at the child in shock, finally seeing evidence that Daisy had, indeed, created a life away from him. Soon, the child then returns to the nanny and leaves when Tom returns with the drinks.</p><p>Tom shows Gatsby the verandas of the home, and the group then sits to eat in a dimly lit dining room while Daisy suggests going into the city.</p><p>Over the table, Tom realizes that Daisy and Gatsby are having an affair when she glamorizes Gatsby and compares him to an advertisement - reveling her attraction to what evidently seems wealthy. Tom then encourages the group to drive into the cityas well.</p><p>While preparing to leave, Gatsby tells Nick that Daisy's voice sounds of money - revealing that Gatsby partly sees a marriage to Daisy as proving his wealth - and status - within the world of "Old Money".</p><p>Everyone leaves for New York City in two separate cars. Tom drives Gatsby’s beige car, and Gatsby drives Tom’s blue car - to ensure that Daisy and Gatsby do not simply run away together, which Tom now suddenly fears.</p><p>They drive to the Valley of Ashes, where Tom stops to get gas and learns that George has also begun to notice Myrtle's affair - but doesn't know with whom. After George announces his intention to move away from Long Island with Myrtle, Tom continues through Astoria and crosses the Queensboro bridge into the city, trying to catch up to Daisy and Gatsby's car, suddenly worried about losing the women around him. During this time, Nick reflects on how Tom is no different than George, except George is now sickly and Tom is strong and healthy due to his status.</p>

                    <p>At 4 PM, the two cars travel up the south side of Central Park to the Plaza Hotel, where they book a parlor suite. Daisy first suggests booking five bathrooms for individual cold baths, but then settles on booking one room and making mint juleps for everyone - even though she does not drink alcohol, and neither does Gatsby.</p><p> Once in the room, a major confrontation occurs, with Tom questioning Gatsby's class and status due to his mysterious past and clear involvement in criminal activity - which includes bootlegging perscription alcohol, rigged gambling, and a more sinister scheme that is not described in detail. </p><p> The conversation ends with Daisy wanting to end her affair with Gatsby - who is clearly not the respectable businessman that she had thought he was, but is instead a dangerous gangster. </p>

However, Wolfsheim responds that he will not attend.</p><p>For two days, the property is filled with police, journalists, and teenagers that sneak onto the grounds to observe the crime scene at the pool, though no one inquires about Gatsby personally or intimately. Nick begins to resent everyone who once came to the parties.</p><p>On the third day, a telegram signed by Henry C. Gatz arrives from Minnesota, asking for the funeral to be postponed until they arrive. The man is Gatsby’s father.</p><p> Henry Gatz arrives soon after, saying he saw the news in a Chicago newspaper. He asks to see his son - "Jimmy" - who is laid in the drawing room. Ironically and sadly, the person who cared about Gatsby most - his father - was left behind as Gatsby reinvented himself, left the Midwest, and chased after his dreams of obtaining wealth and marrying Daisy.</p><p>The funeral is scheduled for the next day at 3PM.</p>

He then walked around to the private beach, clearly imagining the music and voices from the parties that had just been regularly occurring every evekend during the summer.</p><p>He laid on the sand of the private beach, looked across the bay, and saw the green light shining from what used to be Daisy’s dock. He reflected on what Gatsby’s reaction to it had once been.</p>
