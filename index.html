                In 1919, Francis Scott Fitzgerald moved to New York City to pursue a career in writing. However, after having his work endlessly rejected, he returned to his family's home in Minnesota and revised his draft of <cite class = "cite">This Side of Paradise</cite> while repairing the roofs of cars. The final draft was accepted for publishing in the fall of 1919, sold in March of 1920, and instantly became a profitable success.</div>
                
                <div class = "introduction">Five years later, in 1925, <cite class = "cite2">The Great Gatsby</cite> was published and received little attention. It was heavily inspired by Scott Fitzgerald’s own life, the pursuit of his spouse - Zelda, his financial ambitions, and his time living in New York City and Great Neck, Long Island. It was not until World War II - after Scott had already passed away - that the novel became popular and was considered a literary classic.</div>
                
                <div class = "introduction">This website hopes to breathe life into the story by mapping out the real-world locations that Scott was inspired by.</div>

                    <p>Not long after arriving in New York, a coworker invites Nick to room together in a commuter town 20 miles east of the city, called West Egg.</p>
                    <p>West Egg is a fictional town situated at the real-life location of King’s Point in Great Neck, Long Island. In the novel, it’s described as the preferred neighborhood for those with “New Money” - or newly acquired wealth. The homes and residents here are more eccentric than classic or formal.</p>
                    <p>After Nick agrees to move to West Egg, his roommate's job reassigns him to Washington, leaving Nick to move in alone. He brings with him an old Dodge automobile and a pet dog that soon runs away. He also hires a Finnish maid who regularly comes to tidy his room and cook his breakfast, which is an early sign that despite Nick seeing himself as embarking on a self-made path, he hasn’t fully left behind the financial comfort of his upbringing.</p>
                    <p>Nick’s rental home is described as being at the tip of West Egg, just 50 yards from the Long Island Sound, with a direct view of the water. It includes a shed where he parks his car, and sits between two enormous homes.</p>
                    <p>The house to the right is Gatsby’s home.</p>

                    <p>Gatsby's home is styled after the Hotel de Ville in Normandy, France.</p>
                    <p>It includes a single tower, raw ivy climbing up the walls, a marble swimming pool, a private beach with a floating diving tower, a pebbled driveway, Marie Antoinette–style music rooms, imported and restored salons and period bedrooms, multiple dressing rooms, various game rooms, a fully stocked bar, and forty acres of lawn and gardens featuring jonquils, hawthorns, plum blossoms, a white plum tree, and midsummer flowers.</p>
                    <p>Every weekend, Gatsby’s home hosts extravagant public parties, featuring yellow cocktail music and foods that appear almost golden.

                <p>After settling into his new home, Nick drives to East Egg to visit his second cousin, Daisy, and her husband, Tom Buchanan. Tom is a former Yale football star who belonged to the same senior society as Nick.</p>
                <p>Tom and Daisy live just across the bay from Nick, in East Egg – which is on the real-life location of Sands Point, Long Island.  East Egg is described as the preferred neighborhood for those associated with “Old Money,” or wealth that has been inherited across generations. East Egg has a more classic and regal style of architecture, and is filled with white homes.</p>
                <p>The Buchanan home is a red and white Georgian Colonial mansion, with vines growing on the sides, gold-framed French windows, a front porch, connecting verandas, and a lawn that stretches a quarter mile from the beach to the door. The grounds are filled with sun-dials, brick walkways, and well-tended gardens. There is also a dock that goes into the water from the beach, with a green light that flashes all day and night.</p>
                <p>While visiting the Buchanan home, Nick learns about Tom’s poorly hidden affair with another woman, is told about their three-year-old daughter, and meets Jordan Baker. Jordan is Daisy's childhood friend, and she is currently staying at the house. Both Daisy and Jordan are wearing white dresses on this summer evening.</p>
                <p>As Nick reflects on Tom and Daisy’s past, Tom begins to voice blatantly racist views, revealing that he aggressively sees himself as inherently superior to others. His comments reflect his own insecurities about the growing influence of people outside the “Old Money” class and the white race. He worries that the privileges once guaranteed to his social group are no longer assured. As the scene continues, it underscores the hypocrisy of “Old Money,” which maintains the veneer of poise, taste, and manners, but often conceals deep hatred and corruption.</p>
                <p>After 10pm, Jordan retires for the night. Daisy then asks Nick about a woman he is romantically involved with back in Missouri, before he returns to his home in West Egg.</p>

                <p>Between Nick’s home and New York City lies an area known as the Valley of Ashes. At this time, it was as a dumping ground for garbage and ashes from the city. Today, the real-life location is Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens, New York.</p>
                <p>The area is described as being filled with ridges, hills, chimneys, smoke, and a large billboard advertising an optometrist’s practice nearby. A river runs through the area, with a drawbridge that delays trains and traffic when it is raised. A single yellow-brick building sits on the edge of the remains of what was once a small town. The building houses three shops, one of which is a garage with a faded sign that says, “Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.”</p>

                <p>At Pennsylvania Station, Myrtle begins to indulge in various luxuries by asking Tom to buy her cold cream and perfume from the station’s drugstore, along with a magazine from a newsstand. They then head out to the street and wait for a taxi, though Myrtle insists on waiting for a newer model that is specifically painted lavender with a grey interior.</p>

Not long after arriving, Nick steps out to a corner store to buy cigarettes.</p>
                <p>After returning to the apartment, Tom becomes drunkenly enraged with Myrtle as she mentions Daisy's name, and he brutally hits her.</p>
                <p>Though Tom prides himself on his family and manners, he is cruel to those who are not associated with "Old Money". This scene further reveals his hypocrisy. Far from being a loyal husband or a true gentleman, he is aggressive, entitled, and emotionally unfaithful.</p>

                <p>Eventually, he arrives at Pennsylvania Station and waits for the 4am train to go back to Long Island.</p>

                <p>During the ride, Gatsby begins to tell Nick a glamorized version of his past. At first, Nick is reluctant to believe Gatsby's stories, but then wonders if everything is true after being shown with a rare medal that Gatsby received for fighting in World War I. Gatsby wants to show that has he become successful through his own efforts, and Nick questions whether Gatsby truly is a self-made man who gained wealth and success after becoming a war hero.</p>
                <p>As they drive, they pass by a seaside port, cobbled slums, abandoned saloons dating back to the early 1900s, the Valley of Ashes, and Mr. Wilson’s gas station. However the drive is interrupted halfway through Astoria when they are pulled over by a police officer for speeding.</p>
                <p>Gatsby shows his business card after stopping, which causes the officer to refrain from giving a speeding ticket. As this happens, it is clear that Gatsby sees himself as being above the laws that others follow.</p>

                <p>Nick returns to Long Island after his day in the city with Gatsby and Jordan.</p><p>At home, Gatsby intercepts Nick as he arrives, and invites Nick to Coney Island while offering him a job. However, Nick says no to all offers, but agrees to invite Daisy over for tea in two days, giving Gatsby the opportunity to reconnect with her - which is Gatsby's true hope and intention.</p><p>This scene is important since it reveals Gatsby's "New Money" habit of networking and offering Nick money and compensation, instead of simply thanking Nick for his help and friendship.</p>

He is wearing white clothing with a gold tie.</p><p>At 4pm, Daisy arrives and tells her driver to return in an hour.</p><p>Upon entering Nick's home, Daisy is surprised to see Gatsby. Then, after 30 uncomfortable minutes, Nick leaves the two alone for half an hour by exiting through the back door. The rain subsides during this time, though the wind and thunder remain.</p>

                <p>When Nick returns, Gatsby and Daisy have clearly become reacquainted, and it is clear that Daisy has confided in Gatsby while alone. She wipes away some tears as Nick returns. All three then decide to go to Gatsby’s home.</p><p>Together, they explore Gatby's home. Daisy gives extra admiration to the golden items within Gatsby's mansion. While visiting, Gatsby also points out the green light that constantly shines at the end of Daisy’s dock0 which is one of numerous gold and green symbols surround Daisy throughouot the novel, all of which symbolize her ties and connection to "Old Money" and enormous wealth.</p><p>During the tour, Daisy breaks down and begins to cry in Gatsby's room while looking through his collection of luxurious shirts. This can either be her realization that Gatsby could have given her the life she had wanted, or she is realizing that she is truly in love with money instead of the person who holds the wealth.</p><p>After Daisy leaves, Gatsby confides in Nick a little more about his past. It is evident to Nick that Gatsby has achieved the "American Dream" by becoming rich. However, to achieve the dream, he had to reinvent himself, leave his home, and adjust to those around him as needed.</p><p>Though, in the end, it is clear that all of his efforts over the years resulted from a pure motivation: his love for Daisy.</p>

Gatsby also gives more information about when he met Daisy, including details on how she was wearing white and driving a white car.</p><p>Nick warns Gatsby that the dream may be too much to expect, though Gatsby is unwilling to accept that Daisy has changed, made a new life, or moved on since they last saw one another years ago.</p><p>Nick is partially appalled by Gatsby's intentions, seeing that he has turned Daisy into an idealized symbol of perfection in which he has sacrificed his entire identity for.</p>

Daisy reveals that she asked Pammy to wear the dress to meet Gatsby, and tries to introduce the child to the group. However, Pammy instead asks where her father is – Tom. Gatsby also looks at the child in shock, finally seeing evidence that Daisy had, indeed, created a life away from him. Soon, the child returns to the nanny and they both leave when Tom returns with the drinks.</p><p>Tom then tours Gatsby around the home's verandas before everyone sits to eat in a dimly lit dining room while Daisy suggests going into the city.</p><p>Over the table, Tom realizes that Daisy and Gatsby are having an affair when she glamorizes Gatsby and compares him to an advertisement. Tom knows that her attraction falls onto whoever she views as wealthy, and this comparison has revealed her feelings to him. This causes Tom to now encourage the group to drive into the city as well.</p><p>While preparing to leave, Gatsby tells Nick that Daisy's voice sounds of money - showing that Gatsby partly sees a marriage to Daisy as proving his wealth and status within the world of "Old Money".</p><p>Everyone leaves for New York City in two separate cars. Tom drives Gatsby’s beige car, and Gatsby drives Tom’s blue car - to ensure that Daisy and Gatsby do not simply run away together, which Tom now fears.</p><p>They drive to the Valley of Ashes, and Tom stops to get gas at George's shop. Here, Tom learns that George has also begun to notice Myrtle's affair - but doesn't know with whom. After George announces his intention to move away from Long Island with Myrtle, Tom continues through Astoria and crosses the Queensboro bridge into the city, trying to catch up to Daisy and Gatsby's car.</p><p>During this time, Nick reflects on how Tom is no different than George, except George has become sickly from his work and lack of healthcare, while Tom is strong and healthy due to his wealth and status.</p>

Daisy first suggests booking five bathrooms for individual cold baths, but then settles on booking one room and making mint juleps for everyone - even though she does not drink alcohol, and neither does Gatsby.</p><p> Once in the room, a major confrontation occurs, with Tom questioning Gatsby's class and status due to his mysterious past and clear involvement in criminal activity - which includes bootlegging prescription alcohol, rigged gambling, and a more sinister scheme that is not described in detail.</p><p>During the conversation, Gatsby also becomes shocked when Daisy admits that she had, in fact, fallen in love with her husband - Tom - and that her life was not dictated by the single month they had shared together in Louisville - which had become so central to Gatsby's life.</p><p>The conversation ends when Gatsby begomes enraged and almost attacks Tom - showing that Gatsby is also not as gentlemanly as he appears. It is clear that Daisy now wants to end her affair with Gatsby, who is clearly not the respectable businessman that she had thought he was, but is instead a dangerous gangster.</p>

It is also clear that Gatsby has little care for Myrtle's death, and only cares about winning Daisy's heart.</p><p>Nick tries to tell Gatsby that his worries about Tom hurting Daisy are unfounded, though Gatsby doesn't listen.</p><p>In an effort to allay Gatsby’s worries, Nick goes around the home and peers through a window to see Daisy and Tom calmly talking. They are even clearly scheming together, though Nick does not hear their conversation. However, Daisy is obviously in no distress.</p>

                <p>Gatsby tells Nick that he left from Daisy's at 4 AM, after Daisy went to her window, stood for a minute, and then turned off the light without giving any signal.</p><p>Nick and Gatsby go into the drawing room, open some windows, and begin to smoke while Nick tells Gatsby to go to Atlantic City or Montreal to avoid repercussions from the crime the night before. However, Gatsby says he will not leave until he knows what Daisy is going to do. Gatsby is adamant that he will not give up on his dream of being with Daisy - even though it will clearly never happen.</p></p><p>Daybreak arrives and Nick and Gatsby open the rest of the windows before eating breakfast on the porch. Gatsby then invites Nick to swim in the pool before it is drained for the fall, however Nick declines and says he must leave for the next train to go to work.</p><p>Nick compliments Gatsby before leaving, and Nick narrates that it was the only compliment he was able to give him.</p><p>Until now, Nick has disapproved of Gatsby's life to a certain extent. Though, Nick now clearly prefers Gatsby's dream to those of the "rotten crowd" that surrounds them both: Gatsby simply wants to be with Daisy.</p>

                <p>Nick calls Daisy after bringing the body inside. However, he is told by the butler that everyone had already left the Buchanan home with their luggage fully packed.</p><p>Nick also tries to contact Wolfshiem, to notify him of Gatsby’s funeral. However, Wolfsheim responds that he will not attend.</p><p>For two days, the property is filled with police, journalists, and teenagers that sneak onto the grounds to observe the crime scene at the pool, though no one inquires about Gatsby personally or intimately. Nick begins to resent everyone who once came to the parties.</p><p>On the third day, a telegram signed by Henry C. Gatz arrives from Minnesota, asking for the funeral to be postponed until their arrival. The man is Gatsby’s father.</p><p> Henry Gatz arrives soon after, saying he saw the news in a Chicago newspaper. He asks to see his son - "Jimmy" - who is laid in the drawing room. Ironically and sadly, the person who cared about Gatsby most - his father - was left behind as Gatsby reinvented himself, left the Midwest, and chased after his dreams of obtaining wealth and marrying Daisy.</p><p>Gatsby's father, Gatz, spend the day admiring Gatsby's home and possessions, and tells Nick how proud he of the life his son had created and the friends and connections he had made - even though Nick knows that Gatsby was actually alone, and surrounded by people who did not care for him.</p><p>The funeral is scheduled for the next day at 3PM, and Gatz states that Gatsby would have wanted to be buried in New York, where he had built his life, instead of being buried at home in the Midwest - which he ran away from.</p>
