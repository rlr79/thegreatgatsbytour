# thegreatgatsbytour
A digital tour of the locations mentioned in the novel - The Great Gatsby. 

It is with hope that this tour can breathe life into the novel by showing the real-world locations that inspired Scott Fitzgerals. It is also a goal of this site to be useful to teachers and students alike - in both virtual instruction or personal studies.
