# thegreatgatsbytour
A digital tour of the locations mentioned in the novel - The Great Gatsby. 

It is with hope that this tour can breathe life into the novel by showing the real-world locations that inspired Francis Scott Fitzgerald. The site also seeks to be a useful study aid to teachers and students alike - in both virtual instruction or personal studies. The site, which also outlines the story in 51 steps, can help add clarity to those who are lost while reading, or can work as a refresher before discussing new chapters.
