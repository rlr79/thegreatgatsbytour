# thegreatgatsbytour
A digital tour of the locations mentioned in the novel - The Great Gatsby. 

It is with hope that this tour can breathe life into the novel by showing the real-world locations that inspired Francis Scott Fitzgerald. The site also seeks to be a useful study aid to teachers and students alike - in both virtual instruction or personal studies. This site can help add clarity or work as a refresher before discussing new chapters.
