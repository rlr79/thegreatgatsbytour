# thegreatgatsbytour
A digital tour of the locations mentioned within the classic novel, The Great Gatsby. 

This tour hopes to breathe life into the novel by showing the real-world locations that inspired Francis Scott Fitzgerald. It was created during the Covid lockdown, and seeks to be a useful study aid for both teachers and students alike, in both virtual instruction or personal studies. The story is outlined in 51 steps, and can bring clarity to those who are lost while reading the novel, or can work as a refresher before discussing new chapters. It also doubles as a self-guided tour, creating an outdoor activity in New York City that allows for social distancing.
